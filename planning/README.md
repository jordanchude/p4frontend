## Project Description

My final project is a movie database called 'Cinefavorites'. Users will be able to create a login and subsequently login, where they'll be able to add one of their favorite movies to a list of films. The user will be able to add a title, director, description, and image to each film. After adding the film, the dashboard will display the image and title of the film. Once the user clicks on the film, they'll see the image, title, and description of the film on a separate page. On the separate page, they'll be able to add the platforms that they can stream and/or download the film on.
